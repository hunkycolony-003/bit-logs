### Remarks

After a lof of confusion due to the inconsistancies in the different vesrsions of the course cited in the 'proofs' section of Boaz's reccomendations, have decided to complete the proofs unit first from the [2010(fall)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) version of the course, including lectures, recitations and assignments.

The lecture 1 are already done. "Propositions" section and "Proofs about sets" subsection are remaining to read from LLM- 2010, along with recitation 1 and assignment 1.
