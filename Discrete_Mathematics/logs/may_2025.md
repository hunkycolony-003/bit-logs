- Partial part of the first chapter of LLM

## May 10, 2025

### Remarks

After a lof of confusion due to the inconsistancies in the different vesrsions of the course cited in the 'proofs' section of Boaz's reccomendations, have decided to complete the proofs unit first from the [2010(fall)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) version of the course, including lectures, recitations and assignments.

The lecture 1 are already done. "Propositions" section and "Proofs about sets" subsection are remaining to read from LLM- 2010, along with recitation 1 and assignment 1.

## May 23, 2025

### Remarks

- Not fully convinced on the last problem of recitation 2. But such wonderful problems !
- Might start the next part alongside doing problem set 2. Problem set 2 to be completed before starting next problem set.

## May 24, 2025

### Completed tasks

- Problems 4, 5 of problem set 2. Tried some approaches for problem 3, without hint.
- Lecture 5, and partial of 6 on graphs.

### Remarks

- Decided to change the order of topic as mentioned in the advise by boaz. In the 2015 version of the course, whole 'data types' is covered in chapter 4, but in the 2010 version, it is given after the graphs. Currently tending towards covering the topics from my prefered version (mostly 2010), which is mostly resulting in giving more time to it and I am very satisfied with that. Not doing the chapters not mentioned by barak currently, might do afterwards, but trying to solve moreover the problems that he mentions.
- Also went with a lecture and problem set of cs50ai.
- Next few days partial focus on this course only due to curriculum assignments.
