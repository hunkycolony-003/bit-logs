# Overview

This folder tracks my study of Discrete Mathematics, starting May, 2025. The resources and guide suggested by [Boaz Barak](boazbarak.org) in [this page](https://cs121.boazbarak.org/background/) has been tried to follow through (at least initially) with some additional personal prefernces. 

As a background of his course [CS121](cs121.boazbara.org), Boaz has suggested to take a mathemarical course at the level of [CS20](https://lewis.seas.harvard.edu/pages/harvard-computer-science-20-discrete-mathematics-computer-science) but alternatively he has given a guide following [MIT 6.042J](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/), an online publication of which is available [here](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/about), the details of which are given in [this section](https://cs121.boazbarak.org/background/#self-study-using-mit-6-042j).
